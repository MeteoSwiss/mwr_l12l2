mwr_l12l2
=========

Welcome to *mwr_l12l2*'s documentation!

*mwr_l12l2* is a python library dedicated to running optimal estimation retrievals for humidity and temperature profiling for
ground-based microwave radiometers in combination with a model background. This encompasses tools for requesting the
needed ECMWF forecast data, preprocessing tools for running TROPoe as well as postrocessing functions to extract
quality-controlled E-PROFILE level 2 NetCDF formats.

The operational service of `E-PROFILE <https://doi.org/10.1007/s42865-021-00033-w>`__ uses this package to run centralised near real-time retrievals and generate level2
NetCDF messages from its network of ground-based microwave radiometers.
